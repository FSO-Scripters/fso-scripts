# BtASystemViewer
This is a version of Axem's original System Viewer that only runs in GS_STATE_SCRIPTING. It includes complete XSTR compatibility and several bug fixes relating to detecting the proper campaign and next mission. Requires AXUI and IMonitor (Both written by Axem and included here). Example configs are included.
