      "<div>Thanks for choosing to play Between the Ashes. The main campaign has been automatically selected for you to play. There is a lot of lore you can immerse yourself in via the tech room and the news room should you choose to do so. The 2-mission demo, Mefistofele, is also available to play in the campaign room. While the story of the demo takes place during the first couple missions of the main campaign, whether you experience it before or after is up to you.</div>

	  <div>This mod has truly been a labor of love and I hope you enjoy it. - Mjn</div>",
